## Selected Topic
Agriculture is extremely important to the world economy. Understanding global agricultural output is critical for tackling food security concerns (hunger) as the human population continues to grow.

**Crop yield prediction** is a significant agricultural problem. Agricultural yield is largely influenced by meteorological conditions (rain, temperature, etc.) and pesticides, and reliable information about crop yield history is critical for making agricultural risk management and future predictions choices.

Our project consists of three main sections:

- Recommendations: We are trying to advise farmers top three crops to grow in their respective countries (based on each countries' average tempreture, rainfall and used persticide) to maximize total crop yield. 
- Prediction: We trained our ML model on previous data to predict future total yield of selected crops to help farmers/business owners make an informed deicision based on their existing area conditions (rain, temperature, pesticides).
- Analysis:  

## Description of the Source Data
We found our datasets for this project on Kaggle: [Crop_Yield_Prediction_Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patelris/crop-yield-prediction-dataset?select=yield.csv)

We will be using Amazon Web Services to store our data.

*All dataset (publicly available dataset) on Kaggle are taken from [FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization)](http://www.fao.org/home/en/) and [World Data Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/).*

## Communication Protocols
We meet once a week in person and go over details fo the project for upcoming weeks. We also communicate regularly via Whatsapp, Slack and do regular Zoom sessions to keep each other informed about the status of our respective aspects of the project.

## Visualization
We have started building our dashboard containing interactive visualization and forecast generated by our ML models. 

Here, you can find the sketch of the dashboard:
